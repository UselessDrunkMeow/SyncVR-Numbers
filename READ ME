Hi!
This file contains a "short" discription of my game, and some of the choices i made while making it!

The goal of the game is to finsih the drawings by conecting the dots in a specific order. There are three diffrent difficulties.
I decided to make a game that was easy to play, and needed almost no introduction. I wanted it to use only the mouse, and one of its buttons.

I made an editor script to make it easier to make new levels. It works by selecting the NAME object, and moving it to the location where you want to place a connector.
In the inspector you can see three diffrent buttons you can push. 2 of them spawn a connector, at both a diffrent size. one of the removes the latest placed connector.
Simply just press one of the spawn buttons, and a connector will spawn with the correct number already assigned to it.

I tried to make the game look a bit better by making the backgrounds match with the picture. 
I also added a small particle effect for when the player connects the correct numbers.

I tried making it so that ik would be very easy to add more levels when i would want to.
I also tried ading comments to the scripts to make it easier to read.

To open the project, simply pull the git repo to your pc, and it should work (i hope)

Good luck!
